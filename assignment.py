## Write a program that takes 3 numbers from the user and computes the average
first_num_input = int(input('I need 3 numbers from you, give me the first number: ')) 
second_num_input = int(input('Give me the second number: ')) 
third_num_input = int(input('Give me the third number: '))

average = (first_num_input + second_num_input + third_num_input) / 3
print(f'The average is : {average}')



## Write a program that takes a sentence from the user and changes the first word to upper case.
